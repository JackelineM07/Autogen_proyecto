# 🚀 AutoGen Test - Small Experiment with AI Agents  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains a **small experiment** with **AutoGen**, an AI framework for creating autonomous agents powered by GPT-4.  
The goal was to explore how an agent can interact with a language model and automate simple tasks.  

## 🔹 What’s Included?  
- A **basic AutoGen setup** with an **AssistantAgent** and a **UserProxyAgent**  
- Configurations for **GPT-4 API** integration  
- Adjustments to run **without Docker** for a lightweight setup  

## 🔍 Why This Matters?  
AutoGen allows for rapid prototyping of intelligent assistants, making automation more accessible with just a few lines of code.  
While this is a simple implementation, it opens up exciting possibilities for AI-driven workflows.  

## 🚀 Installation & Usage  
1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/JackelineM07/Autogen_proyecto.git
